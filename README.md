# Algorithms

I am using this repository to get up to speed on data structures and algorithms in Python. 

Stanford Courses 1 - 4 are part of the Algorithms Specialization that I am working toward through Coursera. 

I will also be taking USC's Analysis of Algorithms this summer or fall, and my coursework and notes will be stored in a CSCI_570 folder.
