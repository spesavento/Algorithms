# I love Algorithms!

I am using this repository to get up to speed on data structures and algorithms in Python.

#### CSCI 570: Analysis of Algorithms
I took USC's Analysis of Algorithms in Fall 2021, and my coursework and notes are stored in the CSCI_570 folder.

#### Part of Algorithms Specialization (with financial aid)
In a series of four Stanford courses offered via Coursera <br>
1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms **(6/17/2021 - 7/10/2021)**
2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures. **(7/27/2021 - 8/22/2021)**

#### Algorithm Design
I am working through the exercises in this textbook and storing markdown files of my solutions here.
