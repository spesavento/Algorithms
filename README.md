# Algorithms

I am using this repository to get up to speed on data structures and algorithms in Python. 

#### Algorithms Specialization 
A series of four Stanford courses offered via Coursera <br>
1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms (6.17.2021 - present)


#### CSCI 570: Analysis of Algorithms
I will also be taking USC's Analysis of Algorithms this summer or fall, and my coursework and notes will be stored in a CSCI_570 folder.
