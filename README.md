# Algorithms

I am using this repository to get up to speed on data structures and algorithms in Python. 

#### Algorithms Specialization 
A series of four Stanford courses offered via Coursera <br>
1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms **(6/17/2021 - present)**
2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
4. Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them


#### CSCI 570: Analysis of Algorithms
I will also be taking USC's Analysis of Algorithms this summer or fall, and my coursework and notes will be stored in a CSCI_570 folder.
